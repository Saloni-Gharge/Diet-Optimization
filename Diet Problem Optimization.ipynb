    "  <b> Part I: </b>An Executive Summary  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose and Background:**\n",
    "Based on choosing the 'Option B' for our project, the purpose of this report is to provide a detailed meal plan for Starlight's \"Feeding Hope\" project, which aims to address malnutrition among local children due to economic hardship. The aim of the report is to design a weekly meal plan that meets the nutritional needs of children at the lowest cost, while ensuring that the diet is varied and within budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Questions:**\n",
    "Key challenges include providing balanced, nutritious meals to children within limited resources and tight budgets, while ensuring that no single food item accounts for more than 30 percent of total calorie or protein intake.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analysis Methods and Approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### 1. How do we arrive at the optimal solution? \n",
    "> To design the optimal meal plan, we assign a coefficient to each food item and use a looping method to create formulas. These formulas multiply the nutrient content and price of each food item by its coefficient and sums them up to form the basic equation. Additionally, to ensure that \"no single food item should account for more than 30% of the total calories or protein intake,\" we use the looping method to impose this restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### 2. How did we come up with a one-day-a-week plan?\n",
    "> We developed the one-day-a-week plan by constructing a model that applies nutritional and dietary constraints for each day of the week. Using Gurobi, we optimized the meal plan to balance nutrient intake, variety, and cost efficiency. By assigning specific constraints to each day, such as the minimum servings from food groups (e.g., vegetables, proteins, grains), we ensured that the plan provides sufficient variety and maintains a balanced diet. The model minimizes the cost by selecting affordable food combinations that meet daily nutritional goals, making the meal plan both cost-effective and nutritionally adequate for the entire week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Findings and Suggestion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to introduce more high-protein, high-calorie, low-sodium foods, such as poached eggs and beef, to increase protein and calorie intake while controlling sodium content. In addition, it is recommended to adjust food ratios to ensure balanced nutrition and develop a 7-day meal plan that provides different nutritious meals each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of this meal plan is critical to improving the nutritional status of Starlight's children. By implementing this program, children's health and school performance can be improved while providing sustainable nutrition solutions to the community. It is expected that the next step will be to implement this plan and regularly evaluate its effectiveness to ensure continuous improvement.\n"

    "\n",
    "The \"Feeding Hope\" project needs to simultaneously consider both dietary nutritional balance and economic costs. Specifically, the following goals have been identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### **1. Nutritional Requirements:**\n",
    ">Ensure that the children’s daily food intake meets the appropriate nutritional requirements (minimum and maximum recommended daily intake for particular nutrients). The ten key nutrients include Calories (kcal), Fat (g), Sodium (mg), Carbs (g), Fiber (g), Protein (g), Vitamin A (IU), Vitamin C (mg), Calcium (mg), and Iron (mg).\n",
    "The nutritionists involved in the project also recommend that to maintain a balanced diet, no single food item should account for more than 30% of the total calories or protein intake.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### **2. Cost Consideration:**\n",
    "> The team needs to design the meal plan at the lowest possible cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have thirty food options to choose from, including meats such as beef and roasted chicken, dairy products like skim milk, carbohydrates like wheat bread and spaghetti with sauce, vegetables like raw carrots and broccoli, and fruits like bananas and oranges. Each food item contains different proportions of nutrients and has a different price. \n",
    "\n",
    "To design the optimal meal plan, we assign a coefficient to each food item and use a looping method to create formulas. These formulas multiply the nutrient content and price of each food item by its coefficient and sums them up to form the basic equation. Additionally, to ensure that \"no single food item should account for more than 30% of the total calories or protein intake,\" we use the looping method to impose this restriction.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### **Issues:**\n",
    "Based on the meal plan above, there are a few key issues with the current menu:\n",
    "1. **Lack of Vegetables:** The meal plan does not include any vegetables, which contradicts the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations that adolescents should consume at least 400 grams or five portions of fruits and vegetables daily to mitigate the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and to ensure adequate fiber intake. \n",
    "(World Health Organization (WHO) )\n",
    "_https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513708._\n",
    "2. **Dairy Homogenization:** The inclusion of both skim milk and 2% lowfat milk may not provide the variety needed in terms of nutrient profile and could lead to an over-reliance on dairy for certain nutrients.\n",
    "3. **High Fruit Servings with Limited Variety:** While the plan includes a substantial amount of oranges (4.54 servings), there is a lack of variety. Relying on a single fruit does not provide the broad spectrum of nutrients found in different fruits, and it may not meet the recommended daily intake when considering the total grams recommended by WHO.\n",
    "4. **Excessive Carbohydrate Intake from Starches:** The plan includes three types of starchy foods (baked potatoes, spaghetti with sauce, and white rice), which could lead to excessive carbohydrate intake and potentially higher caloric consumption than necessary, especially if not balanced with adequate physical activity.\n",
    "5. **Low Meat Serving Size:** With only 0.57 servings of pork, the meal plan may not provide enough protein to meet the daily requirements, which is essential for growth and maintenance in children.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Recommendations:**\n",
    "1. **Introduce a Variety of Vegetables:** To align with WHO's recommendations, incorporate a variety of vegetables into the meal plan. This could include a mix of leafy greens, root vegetables, and other colorful vegetables to provide a wide range of nutrients and fiber.\n",
    "2. **Balance Macronutrients:** Adjust the proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to ensure a balanced meal that meets the nutritional needs without exceeding caloric intake.\n",
    "3. **Increase Meat Sources:** Consider adding more servings of meat such as chicken, turkey and so on.\n",
    "4. **Avoid Dairy Homogenization:** While dairy can be part of a healthy diet, ensure it is consumed in moderation alongside other food groups to maintain a balanced diet.\n",
    "By addressing these issues, the meal plan can be improved to better support the health and nutritional needs of the children.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Optimization Plan:**\n",
    "1.\tWe have set an upper limit on each food item: \"servings cannot exceed 2.\"\n",
    "2.\tWe have divided the foods into the following groups:\n",
    ">> **Vegetables:** Broccoli, Carrots (Raw), Corn, Lettuce (Iceberg, Raw), Peppers (Sweet, Raw), Potatoes (Baked), Tomato (Red, Ripe, Raw)\n",

    "\n",
    ">> **Dairy:** 2% Lowfat Milk, Skim Milk\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Other:** Spaghetti W/ Sauce, Macaroni (cooked)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each group must contain at least one food item (in case of vegetables atleast 2)\n",

    "The new constraints will likely lead to a slightly higher cost but will produce a more practical and balanced meal plan. The maximum serving size constraint prevents overloading one food item, and the variety constraint ensures the child gets a balanced intake from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optimized Model Results Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing food frequency constraints and varying meal components, we ensure that children receive a diverse and balanced diet throughout the week. The optimized model allows for:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Nutritional Adequacy**\n",
    "> The meal plan meets the daily nutritional needs while adhering to dietary guidelines. It provides a balanced intake of macronutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, all within the recommended ranges. For instance, the plan offers 1800 kcal, which is within the 1800-2400 kcal range, and 55g of protein, aligning with the 40-55g recommendation. Additionally, micronutrients like Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron are all met, indicating that the plan is nutritionally adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Meal Variety and Nutritional Balance**\n",
    "> The plan introduces a variety of foods across different food groups, which helps maintain interest and enjoyment while ensuring a nutritionally balanced diet. The inclusion of fruits like bananas and oranges, vegetables with the raw apple, and a mix of protein sources from milk, pork, and bread provides a diverse range of nutrients. Combining meal variety with nutritional balance is crucial for overall health and to prevent dietary monotony.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cost Control**\n",
    "> The overall cost of the meal plan is minimized at $2.51 per day, which is an affordable daily expenditure for nutritious meals. This cost control is achieved without compromising on the quality or variety of food, indicating efficient menu planning and cost management. Maintaining cost efficiency is essential for the sustainability of such a meal plan, especially when catering to a large number of children.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Practicality**\n",
    "> The meal plan is practical in terms of serving sizes and meal compositions suitable for children. Portion sizes are reasonable and align with dietary recommendations to prevent overeating or nutrient deficiencies. The meal compositions are also practical, considering the ease of preparation and the likelihood of children consuming the offered foods. For example, baked potatoes, white rice, and spaghetti are familiar and easily accessible items that are typically well-received by children.\n",
    "In summary, the meal plan demonstrates nutritional adequacy by meeting daily requirements, offers variety to ensure interest and enjoyment, maintains cost control for affordability, and is practical for implementation in a real-world setting suitable for children. These factors contribute to the overall effectiveness of the meal plan in promoting health and well-being.\n"

    "### **Explanation of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the part (d), we created a 7-day meal plan by ensuring that nutritional requirements are met while minimizing costs and maintaining variety throughout the week. The solution was developed using Gurobi Optimizer and a model that incorporates dietary constraints for each day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Elements of the Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Inputs:**\n",
    "- We used a dataset of food items from an Excel file, which includes the cost and nutritional content of each item (e.g., calories, protein, fat, vitamins, etc.).\n",
    "- The code loads two sheets: the first contains food data (with associated nutrients and costs), and the second contains nutritional requirements (e.g., minimum and maximum daily intake values for various nutrients).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food Groups:**\n",
    "The foods were categorized into the following groups:\n",
    "- **Vegetables:** Broccoli, Carrots, Corn, etc.\n",
    "- **Fruits:** Apples, Bananas, Grapes, etc.\n",
    "- **Grains/Breads:** Wheat Bread, White Bread, Oatmeal, etc.\n",
    "- **Proteins:** Chicken, Beef, Pork, Eggs, etc.\n",
    "- **Dairy:** 2% Lowfat Milk, Skim Milk\n",
    "- **Other:** Spaghetti with Sauce, Macaroni\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daily Constraints:**\n",
    "Each day had a specific set of constraints on how many servings from each food group should be included:\n",
    "- Example for Day 1: At least 2 vegetables, 2 proteins, 1 grain/bread, 1 fruit, 1 dairy, and 1 \"other\" item.\n",
    "- These constraints varied day by day to ensure variety in the meal plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Optimization:**\n",
    "- The code creates a Gurobi model that defines the objective to minimize the total weekly cost while ensuring that all the nutritional requirements are met (e.g., calories, fat, protein, vitamins, etc.).\n",
    "- Slack and excess variables are included to handle soft constraints on nutritional intake (e.g., slightly exceeding the maximum or falling below the minimum requirements adds a penalty to the cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Constraints:**\n",
    "- **Variety:** Each meal plan must include at least 6 different food items per day.\n",
    "- **Food Group Proportions:** No single food should contribute more than 30% of total calories or protein intake.\n",
    "- **Max Servings:** A limit of 3 servings per food was imposed to avoid overreliance on a single item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daily Optimization:**\n",
    "For each day, the model optimizes the meal plan by selecting the optimal combination of foods that meet the given constraints and minimizes the cost. If an optimal solution is found, the code prints the total cost, the food items chosen, the number of servings, and the total intake of each nutrient.\n"
